Build a simple browser-based web application with no authentication.

The purpose of this application is to modify Word documents by replacing highlighted text based on a user-provided instruction prompt.

UI REQUIREMENTS
- A clean single-page interface
- A file upload input that accepts a single .docx Word document, labeled “Instruction Prompt"
- A file upload input that accepts a single .docx Word document, Labelled "Client Data"
- A button labeled “Generate Updated Document”
- After processing, provide a download link for the updated Word document

CORE BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL)
- The input file entered in “Instruction Prompt” is the authoritative content-generation prompt
- This prompt MUST be used to decide how highlighted text in the Word document is rewritten
- The system must apply the instruction prompt to update the document content

DOCUMENT PROCESSING RULES
- The uploaded Word document will contain highlighted text
- The system must identify ONLY highlighted text in the document
- Highlighted text represents placeholders that must be replaced using the instruction prompt
- All non-highlighted text must remain unchanged
- The original document structure, formatting, tables, styles, headers, and layout must be preserved exactly

PROCESSING LOGIC
- Read the user-provided Instruction Prompt
- Open the uploaded Word document
- For each highlighted section in the document:
  - Use surrounding headings, paragraphs, and table context to understand what that section represents
  - Generate replacement content by following the Instruction Prompt
  - Replace ONLY the highlighted text with the generated content
- Each highlighted section must be handled independently
- Do not merge, remove, or reorder sections
- Do not modify any non-highlighted content

CONTENT RULES
- Preserve the professional tone and writing style of the document
- Generate realistic, professional, and internally consistent text and numbers
- If numeric or financial values are required, generate reasonable professional estimates
- If authorship, preparer, reviewer, or employee context is implied, use the name “Romit Acharya”
- Do NOT override client names, beneficiary names, or third-party individuals

DOCUMENT OUTPUT
- The output must be a valid .docx Word file
- Formatting must be preserved exactly
- The updated document must be downloadable by the user

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
- No authentication
- No database required
- No external integrations required
- Use any suitable client-side or server-side approach to preserve Word formatting
- Focus on correctness and document integrity over UI complexity

FINAL OUTPUT
- A fully working web application
- User provides:
  1) An Instruction Prompt that defines how the document should be updated
  2) A Word document containing highlighted placeholders
- User receives:
  - A new Word document where ONLY highlighted text has been updated according to the Instruction Prompt

Do not add extra features.
Do not ask follow-up questions.
Do not explain the solution.
Just build the working application.
